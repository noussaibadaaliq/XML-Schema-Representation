# XML Schema Representation

This repository contains tools and scripts to parse, analyze, and represent XML schema files (XSD) effectively. The primary focus is on extracting meaningful information, such as elements, attributes, and their documentation, from XML schemas. This work can be particularly useful for tasks such as schema matching or understanding complex XML structures.

## Project Overview
The core functionality is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`ipynb` file), which demonstrates the following:

- Parsing XML schema files using Python libraries (`xml.etree.ElementTree` and `lxml`).
- Extracting elements, their attributes, and associated documentation from the schema.
- Representing the schema structure hierarchically to understand relationships between elements and attributes.
- Saving the extracted schema details to a structured format (e.g., JSON) for further analysis.

### Example Use Case
For an XML schema like:
```xml
<xs:element name="entry" type="entryType">
    <xs:annotation>
        <xs:documentation>Describes a UniProtKB entry.</xs:documentation>
    </xs:annotation>
</xs:element>
```
The scripts extract:
- **Element Name**: `entry`
- **Type**: `entryType`
- **Documentation**: `Describes a UniProtKB entry.`

## Features
- **XML Parsing**: Handles XML schema files efficiently.
- **Schema Representation**: Extracts and organizes elements, attributes, and documentation.
- **File Format Support**: Processes `.xml` and `.xsd` files.
- **Extensible**: The code is modular and can be adapted for specific schema analysis tasks.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - `lxml`
  - `xml.etree.ElementTree` (part of Pythonâ€™s standard library)

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install lxml
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/XML-Schema-Representation.git
   cd XML-Schema-Representation
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook**:
   Launch the Jupyter Notebook to explore and run the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Run the Analysis**:
   - Load your XML schema file into the `ipynb` file.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to parse and analyze the schema.
   - View and save the extracted schema details.

4. **Output**:
   - The script generates a JSON file containing the extracted schema details, which you can review or use for other tasks.
